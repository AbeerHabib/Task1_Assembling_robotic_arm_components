# Robotic Arm
The robotic arm is composed of various components, each has its own purpose. These components typically include:
1. Base/Waist: This is the foundation of the arm where the circuitry is putted in, and then motors connect to.
2. Shoulder: The shoulder is the second piece of the arm that connect to the links and facilitate movement.
3. Links: These are the segments that connect to one another using joints, creating the arm's extended structure.
4. Joints: they are usually connected to motors and enable the robot to move.
5. End Effector/Gripper: The most important part of the robotic arm. It comes in various types and sizes depending on the tasks the robot is designed to perform.

## Steps for assembling the components of a robotic arm:
1. Position the base and ensure that the surface with a flat area is on the ground. The hole at the bottom of the base should be facing towards you, as this is where the wires will be picked from.
2. Attach the shoulder to the top of the base, using it as a cover. Make sure that the side of the shoulder with a rectangular empty space, designed for the motor placement, is at the back. The other side should face towards you.
3. Align the first link vertically in front of the shoulder, ensuring that the flat surface of the link touches the shoulder. You may be confused between the ends of the link because they are similar to each other, so place the end that has a small extra part facing downwards.
4. Place the second link vertically behind the first link, aligning the holes designed for the joints together. Note that the side with two motor holes should not be adjacent to the first link.
5. Finally, position the end effector (gripper) in front of the second link, aligning the holes designed for the joints together.
