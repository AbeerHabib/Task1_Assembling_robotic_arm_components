# Robotic Arm
The robotic arm is composed of various components, each has its own purpose. These components typically include:
1. Base/Waist: This is the foundation of the arm where the circuitry is putted in, and then motors connect to.
2. Shoulder: The shoulder is the second piece of the arm that connect to the links and facilitate movement.
3. Links: These are the segments that connect to one another using joints, creating the arm's extended structure.
4. Joints: they are usually connected to motors and enable the robot to move.
5. End Effector/Gripper: The most important part of the robotic arm. It comes in various types and sizes depending on the tasks the robot is designed to perform.

## Steps for assembling the components of a robotic arm:
1. Place the base so that the surface with a flat and largest area is on the ground, and the hole at the bottom of the base is in front of you, the wires are picked from this hole.
2. Place the shoulder at the top of the base as a cover for it. One of the sides of the shoulder has a rectangular empty space which is designed to place the motor in, this side must be in the back, and the other side should face you.
3. Place the first link vertically in front of the shoulder so that the flat surface is touching the shoulder, you may be confused about the ends of the link cause it similar to each other, so put the end that has a small extra part down.
4. Place the second link vertically behind the first link so that the holes designed for the joints fit together, notice that the side with two motor holes is the side that is not next to the first link.
5. Place the end effector (gripper) in front of the second the holes designed for the joints fit together.
