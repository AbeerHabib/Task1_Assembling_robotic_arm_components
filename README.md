Creating a robotic arm using 3D software

# Task 1: Connect robotic arm parts

The robotic arm consists of several basic pieces that may differ in their names, generally it is:
1. The base, which is the part that the circuit putted in and then motors connect to.
2. Waist/shoulder, which is the second piece which connects to the links.
3. Links, which connect to each other using joints.
4. Joints, which usually connect to motors to allow the robot to move.
5. End effector/Gripper, which is the most important part of the robot arm and it has many types and sizes and it depends on the type of work the robot is doing.



# *steps:*
1. Place the base so that the surface with a flat and largest area is on the ground, and the hole at the bottom of the base is in front of you, the wires are picked from this hole.
2. Place the waist at the top of the base as a cover for it. One of the sides of the waist has a rectangular empty space which is designed to place the motor in, this side must be in the back, and the other side should face you.
3. Place the first link vertically in front of the waist so that the flat surface is touching the waist, you may be confused about the ends of the link cause it similar to each other, so put the end that has a small extra part down.
4. Place the second link vertically behind the first link so that the holes designed for the joints fit together, notice that the side with two motor holes is the side that is not next to the first link.
5. Place the end effector (gripper) in front of the second the holes designed for the joints fit together.
